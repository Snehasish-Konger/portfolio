If you're a coder, you know that plagiarism is a huge no-no. Not only is it unethical, but it can also get you into a lot of legal trouble. Plagiarism is defined as "the unauthorized use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own original work." In other words, plagiarism is when you copy someone else's code and claim it as your own.

There are a few different ways that you can plagiarize code. The first, and most obvious, is to simply copy and paste someone else's code into your own project. This is an act of blatant plagiarism and is sure to get you into trouble if you're caught.

Another way to plagiarize code is to slightly modify someone else's code and claim it as your own. This is called "code morphing" and is just as bad as copying and pasting someone else's code. Code morphing is when you take someone else's code and make a few small changes to it, such as changing variable names or adding a few lines of code. While this may seem like a harmless way to borrow code, it's actually just as bad as copying and pasting someone else's code.

The best way to avoid plagiarism is to simply write your own code. If you're struggling with a particular problem, take a look at other people's code for inspiration, but don't copy it. Try to understand how they solved the problem and then apply that knowledge to your own code.

If you do find yourself borrowing code from someone else, be sure to give them credit. Always include comments in your code that indicate where you got the code from. For example, if you're using someone else's code in your project, you might include a comment that says, "borrowed from Snehasish's project." By giving credit where it's due, you can avoid plagiarism altogether.
